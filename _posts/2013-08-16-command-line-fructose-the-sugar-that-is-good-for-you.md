The healthy sugar that you can use in your command-line work. Taking a look at some convinient tweaks.

## Few notes
The code samples are targetting debian based OSs and it was tested on Ubuntu 13.04.

## Removing long login greeting message.
That thing:
```

```
or something similar that appears every time you login (especially remotely).

Which is the least - distracting. So to remove it:
```
touch ~/.hushlogin
```

## Some packages to start with
```
sudo apt-get install zsh fortune cowsay htop git
```
## Setting `zsh` as default shell
```
sudo chsh -s `which zsh` ubuntu # where ubuntu is your username
```

sudo make install
```
## Inline syntax highlighting
As described on [zsh-syntax-highlighting plugin page](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) it is a [Fish shell](http://fishshell.com/ ) like inline sytax highlighting

Basically it does coloured command line prompt:
